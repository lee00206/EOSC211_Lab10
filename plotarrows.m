function plotarrows(filename,decfac,scfac) 
% PLOTARROWS  Plots mean currents
%    PLOTARROWS(DECFAC,SCFAC) takes the gridded

%    available by anonftp to ftp://jerry.rsmas.miami.edu/pub/MGSVA/
%    and makes a nice plot. You can subsample the
%    complete dataset by a decimation factor DECFAC,
%    and scale the arrows by a scaling SCFAC (which
%    has units of 'degrees per m/s')


% This code is supposed to make a map showing ocean current vectors
% as arrows, superimposed on a gray-scaled image of the current
% MAGNITUDES.

csvdata=load(filename);   % Load the data in the arrow file 

% Data are in a long list, so insert them into
% rectangular matrices of the right dimensions

[LG,LT,U,V]=move_to_grid(csvdata); 


% We want to cut down the size of the data matrices so that
% not every arrow gets plotted (figures become messy). We can
% do this be 'subsampling', but first we want to smooth the
% data so as not to introduce 'aliasing' problems.
%
% So, smooth the data matrices by taking
% a running mean in both dimensions. We choose the window length 
% to be the same size as our subsampling interval 'decfac':
Um=mean2d(U,decfac);
Vm=mean2d(V,decfac); %get mean from V

% ..and now we subsample, or decimate, by taking only a subset of 
% points  - we want every 'decfac'-th point.
rLG=LG(1:decfac:end, 1:decfac:end);
rLT=LT(1:decfac:end, 1:decfac:end);
rUM=Um(1:decfac:end, 1:decfac:end);
rVM=Vm(1:decfac:end, 1:decfac:end);

% Draw the image. Use the MAGNITUDE of the velocity for the 
% colour scale
     
imagesc(rLG(:,1),rLT(1,:),(Um+Vm)); %switch x and y positions because longitudes are x and latitudes are y
handle=colorbar('eastoutside');
set(get(handle,'ylabel'),'string','Current speed (m/s)');
caxis([0 .5]);

load m_coasts;  % load a coastline
line(ncst(:,1),ncst(:,2),'color','w'); % draw the coastline %need to have '' when specifying the color

set(gca,'ydir','normal','tickdir','out');
colormap(hot);

ylabel('Latitude');


% Tricky way of drawing lots of lines all
% at once. Replaces a double loops!

% Basic idea is to draw lines from a particular lat/long in
% the direction of U/V. However, degrees of longitude get closer
% together as we get nearer to poles, so we have to make the
% U-components larger to compensate and end up with arrows pointing
% in the right direction. We do this by dividing by the cosine
% of the latitude.

ii=isfinite(rUM(:)); %find indices (linear indexing) where vels exist
x=rLG(ii);  %longitudes
y=rLT(ii); %latitudes
%multiplying by scaling factor determines relative length of arrows
dx=rUM(ii)./cosd(rLT(ii)).*scfac;
dy=rVM(ii).*scfac;

% Plotting a thin red line on top of a thick white line 
% enhances the contrast. 
%
% These 2 lines of code draw the lines in a straightforward
% way, by making each line segment a column of the final arrays.
% However, because each of the >40k line segments are in separate 
% columns Matlab will create >40k graphics objects (which with a 2-point
% line) which takes a LONG time.
%
%   line([x x+dx]',[y y+dy]','color','w','linewidth',2);
%   line([x x+dx]',[y y+dy]','color','r');
%
% Instead, it is much faster to plot a SINGLE line with all
% >40k line segments, separated by NaNs.

X=[x x+dx NaN(size(x))]';  % Makes rows with 2 points and NaN,
                           % and turns it into a column using ' 
X=X(:);                    % Then strips all the columns into a
                           % a long column vector
Y=[y y+dy NaN(size(y))]';Y=Y(:);

line(X,Y,'color','w','linewidth',2);

% MOVE_TO_GRID    Puts data into a grid
%
% Each data file consists of lines, written in fortran free format,
% in the form of
% 15000., longitude, latitude, e-w velocity u, s-n velocity v, std. dev u, std. dev v
% They are in 1 degree boxes, centered on the integer lat/long

% Set up the grid on which the data was created.
LONG=[-179:180];
LAT=[-89:89];
[mLG,mLT]=meshgrid(LONG,LAT);  

%Initializing with NaNs also automatically deals with points where there is
%no data (eg. on land) because those locations will simply contain NaNs
U=NaN(179,360);
V=NaN(179,360);

% Loop through all points in .csv file.
%
% For each, calculate the row/col indices
% from the lat/longs.  Lats get converted
% into row indices 'i', and longs into column
% indices 'j'. Since we have a 1 degree spacing
% we just have to add the right offset
% to make this work - for example, for latitudes
% latitude of -89 goes to row 1,
% latitude of -88 goes to row 2, etc.
%
% Then write the
% corresponding U/V data for that lat/long
% into the right place (i.e. index (i,j) )
% in the U/V matrices 

for k=1:size(csvdata,1) %no need to have comma, A is undefined and A is actually a csvdata
   i=csvdata(k,3)+90;    %row index 
   j=csvdata(k,2)+180;     %column index %add 90 to lon (2nd column)
   U(i,j)=csvdata(k,4);
   V(i,j)=csvdata(k,5);
